# Open-props in Gleam

Monorepo for using the excellent [open-props](https://open-props.style) design
token system in Gleam.

The package you want to install is [./open_props](./open_props/). It has some
docs as well.

For examples of how to use, see [./examples](./examples/).

If you are interested in the dumb script that generates the gleam code from the
open-props sources, see [./open_props_generator/](./open_props_generator/).
